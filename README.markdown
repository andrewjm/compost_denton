# Compost App

## Purpose

This app is designed to help community composting organizations with data collection.

1. Add members
2. Log each pickup weight
3. Track your waste diversion!

## Dependencies

This app is built on the following technologies:

* Ruby 2.0
* Rails 4.2.0
* PostgreSQL 9.4.2

## Hosted options

A hosted production instance is available at [compostapp.com](http://compostapp.com). It is hosted on Heroku and managed by yours truly. All are welcome and encouraged to utilize the hosted option for both ease and nation-wide organizational purposes. I ask that those with accounts at compostapp.com contribute a small monthly donation to help keep the lights on. Of course, in the spirit of open source, no one is required to use the hosted option!
